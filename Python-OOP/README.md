# Intro to OOP
## Objectives:
Introduction to object oriented programming and its benefits
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is something that has revolutionized the way programming is done today. If used correctly, it can save you loads of time. It will also help you to avoid repeating code that solves the same simple problem, making code maintenance easy. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use and implement OOP.

Understanding object-oriented programming principles is the key to making your code more organized and modular. This chapter will teach you object-oriented programming principles to help you better understand how to organize your code in the future.

The goal of this chapter is to help us understand:

* what objects and classes are and why they are useful,
* how to create classes and objects in Python,
* the basic building blocks of objects (attributes and methods),
* more advanced OOP concepts (inheritance, super, etc.),
* how data structures utilize OOP concepts, and
* the difference between procedural and OOP code.
* Would it surprise you to know that you have been taking advantage of OOP already? For example, you know that you can call the append method if you're working with a list, but not with a dictionary or a number. You know that you can get the length of a list or dictionary, but not of a boolean. That is because each type of thing, or object, has specific properties and functionality associated with it.

This grouping, or encapsulating, of properties and functionalities by object is a fundamental principle of OOP and is implemented with classes.

To better understand these concepts, we'll start by creating some of our own classes by representing real-world things, and then go a little more abstract as we peek inside of a few data structures.
